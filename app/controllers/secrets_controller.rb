  # NOTE: We're following REST/http semantics here by representing this as 
  #       an "expirations" that you POST to you.  This may seem strange given
  #       that what we're doing is simply updating an attribute on a secret.
  #       But keep in mind this purely an implementation detail -- we could 
  #       have implemented expirations in many ways.  We want to expose the
  #       concept of an "expiration" to the user.  And per standard rest, 
  #       we do that with a resource, "expirations."  Expiring a variable
  #       is then a matter of POSTing to create a new "expiration" resource.
  #       
  #       It is irrelevant that the server happens to implement this request
  #       by assigning nil to `expires_at`.
  #
  #       Unfortuneatly, to be consistent with our other routes, we're abusing
  #       query strings to represent what is in fact a new resource.  Ideally,
  #       we'd use a slash instead, but decided that consistency trumps 
  #       correctness in this case.

# React Selectize

## v0.1.1 / 11th September 2015

* changed filterOptions signature for SimpleSelect from `[Item] -> Item -> String -> [Item]` to `[Item]-> String -> [Item]`

## v0.1.2 / 11th September 2015
* updated package.json added keywords & removed license property

## v0.1.3 / 12th September 2015

## v0.1.4 / 15th September 2015
* fixed option menu toggle on tap/click in mobile safari

## v0.1.6 / 19th September 2015
* introduced a new prop `autosize`, allows consumers to provide custom autosize logic for search input, the default implementation now supports nonmodern browsers

## v0.2.0 / 19th September 2015
* drop in replacement for React.DOM.Select, accepts options as children
* added a new prop `dropdownDirection`, setting it to -1 forces the options menu to open upwards
